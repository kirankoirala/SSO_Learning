# SSO_Learning

1. Clone.
2. Compile in Visual Studio (2017 preffered)
3. Run the Sso.MyAppOne 
    a. Observe that it will redirect to the Sso.MySso for login 
 4. After successful login
    a. Observe that it will redirect to MyAppOne
 5. Run MyApp2
    a. Observe that it will not ask for login this time. 
    
    
Go through the code to understand. Give close attension to **AccountController** in MySso and **Web.Config** in all application. 
Should be straight forward. 

Thanks
