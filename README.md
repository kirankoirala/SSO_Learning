# SSO_Learning

1. Clone.
2. Compile in Visual Studio (2017 preffered)
3. Run the Sso.MyAppOne 
    + Observe that it will redirect to the Sso.MySso for login
    + username and password for login is 'demo'
 4. After successful login
    + Observe that it will redirect to MyAppOne
 5. Run MyApp2
    + Observe that it will not ask for login this time. 
    
    
Go through the code to understand. Give close attension to **AccountController** in MySso and **Web.Config** in all application. 
Should be straight forward. 

Thanks
